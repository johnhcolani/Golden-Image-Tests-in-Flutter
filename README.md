# Flutter Golden Image Testing Project

This repository showcases a Flutter project that demonstrates the implementation of Golden Image Testing. Golden image tests are a crucial tool for ensuring the visual consistency of your Flutter application's UI across different versions.

The project includes a simple login screen with custom UI elements, and the associated tests capture snapshots (golden images) to detect unintended changes in the UI. By using golden image tests, you can safeguard your app's visual integrity and catch UI regressions early in the development process.

# Features
## Custom Login Screen: 
A clean and simple login screen built with Flutter, featuring custom clipping and layout.
## Golden Image Testing: 
Demonstrates how to implement golden image testing in Flutter to maintain UI consistency.
## Automated UI Testing: 
Ensures that the appâ€™s UI does not change unexpectedly during development.
